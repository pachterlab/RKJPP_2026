# An upper bound on the genomic information decodable from CT in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma

**TCGA-KIRC (n = 190, multi-institutional) | four CT representations | linear-Gaussian recoverability bound**

This notebook produces the four-representation TCGA-KIRC numbers quoted in the manuscript.

The question is not "how well does *my* model predict genotype from CT?" but
**"what is the largest R^2 that *any* decoder could achieve?"**  Under a
linear-Gaussian channel the answer is closed-form and reduces to canonical
correlation analysis, so the ceiling can be estimated without ever training a
predictor.

Pipeline:

1. Load TCGA-KIRC tumor RNA-seq and four CT feature representations (tumor and
   organ pyradiomics, tumor and whole-volume RadImageNet deep features).
2. State the ceiling: for any linear genomic score `v'G`, the Bayes-optimal
   `R^2` is `R(v) = 1 - v'S_{G|X}v / v'S_g v`, and `sup_v R(v) = rho_1^2`, the
   squared leading canonical correlation.
3. **Show that the in-sample leading canonical correlation is not usable as that
   ceiling at n = 190** --- it sits at or below its own permutation null, because
   with p* + d* comparable to n the statistic is set by random-matrix geometry
   rather than by biology.  This is the methodological correction in the abstract.
4. Estimate the ceiling honestly: cross-validated leading recoverability with a
   permutation null on the same statistic and a bootstrap upper confidence limit.
   Report the companion budget terms --- mutual information in bits and the
   effective image-identifiable rank.
5. Ask whether the surviving signal is *kidney-cancer* biology, by restricting to
   an a-priori ccRCC gene panel and comparing against size-matched random panels.
6. Ask whether it is *genomic* at all, by residualizing both modalities on
   demographics (and scanner manufacturer) and recomputing the ceiling.

## 1. Cohort, transcriptome and CT representations

190 TCGA-KIRC patients have both a contrast-enhanced CT in TCIA and tumor RNA-seq in
the GDC.  Expression is library-size normalized to median depth, `log1p`-transformed,
filtered to genes detected in >10% of patients, and reduced to the 2000 most variable
genes.  Four CT representations are carried in parallel so the reported ceiling can be
the most generous of the four rather than an artifact of one feature set.

## 2. What the bound is

Model the genomic state as Gaussian and the image as a noisy linear readout of it,

$$G \sim \mathcal N(0, \Sigma_g), \qquad X \mid G \sim \mathcal N(AG,\ \sigma^2 I).$$

Then every downstream quantity is closed-form.  For a named genomic score $Y = v^\top G$
(a gene, a pathway score, a signature) the *recoverability*

$$R(v) \;=\; 1 - \frac{v^\top \Sigma_{G\mid X} v}{v^\top \Sigma_g v}$$

is exactly the population $R^2$ of the **Bayes-optimal** predictor of $Y$ from imaging.
No estimator --- linear, kernel, or deep --- can beat it.  Maximizing over $v$ gives the
single tightest number,

$$\sup_v R(v) \;=\; \rho_1^2, \qquad
\rho_1 = \sigma_{\max}\!\left(\Sigma_g^{-1/2}\,\Sigma_{gx}\,\Sigma_x^{-1/2}\right),$$

the squared leading canonical correlation of the whitened cross-covariance.  So the
ceiling is a CCA problem and $A$, $\sigma^2$ never have to be estimated.

Two companion terms describe *how much* rather than *how well*: the mutual information
$I(G;X) = -\tfrac12\sum_i \log(1-\rho_i^2)$, and the effective image-identifiable rank
(how many canonical directions survive a null).
""")

md(r"""
## 3. Why the in-sample leading canonical correlation is not that ceiling

$\rho_1^2$ is the right *population* object, but the in-sample plug-in estimate is not a
usable estimate of it at this sample size.  With working dimensions $p^\star = d^\star =
n/5$, the whitened cross-covariance is a random matrix even when the two modalities are
independent, and its top singular value concentrates near the Wachter edge

$$\rho_{1,\text{null}}^2 \;\approx\; \left(\sqrt{\kappa_g(1-\kappa_x)} + \sqrt{\kappa_x(1-\kappa_g)}\right)^2,
\qquad \kappa = p^\star/n .$$

The cell below computes, for each CT representation, the in-sample $\rho_1^2$ **and** the
distribution of the same statistic under permuted patient labels.  If the observed value
does not clear its own null, the number is measuring dimensionality, not biology.

### 3a. A tie-handling correction that the deep-feature results depend on

The copula step maps each feature to a normal marginal through its ranks.  `rgit`'s
`gaussian_rank_transform` ranks with `argsort(argsort(.))`, which breaks **ties by row
order** --- so a feature that is zero in most patients is turned into a ramp in patient
index.  RadImageNet features are ReLU outputs (median 73% zeros for the tumor volume)
and lowly expressed genes are zero-inflated, so this manufactures the *same* index ramp
as the leading principal component of both modalities and couples them spuriously.

Measured on this cohort with a random 158-gene panel against tumor deep features:

| rank rule | corr(genomic PC1, patient index) | corr(imaging PC1, patient index) | `R1_cv` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `argsort` (rgit default) | 0.76 | 0.77 | **+0.74** |
| tie-averaged | 0.17 | 0.15 | +0.01 |

The true value is zero --- the genes are random.  This notebook therefore uses
tie-averaged ranks and additionally drops any feature whose modal value covers more than
half the cohort, where a copula transform is not defined.  Pyradiomics features have no
ties and are essentially unaffected; every deep-feature number changes.

## 4. The honest ceiling

`R1_cv` refits the canonical directions inside each training fold and scores the
held-out squared correlation, so it carries no in-sample optimism.  Its permutation null
is built from the identical statistic, putting observed and null on one scale.  A
non-parametric bootstrap over patients gives a one-sided 95% upper confidence limit ---
the number that actually constrains the field, since it is the largest ceiling
consistent with these data.

That bootstrap has to be **grouped**.  Resampling patients with replacement otherwise
places duplicates of one patient on both sides of a k-fold split, so the "held-out"
correlation stops being held out; left uncorrected the interval drifts back up to the
in-sample value it was introduced to replace (0.55 rather than 0.09 for tumor
radiomics).  Folds are therefore grouped on the original patient index.

## 5. Is the surviving signal kidney-cancer biology?

An a-priori ccRCC panel is assembled from published somatic drivers, the KEGG renal cell
carcinoma pathway (hsa05211), the VHL-HIF hypoxia axis that defines ccRCC, and
nephron/angiogenesis markers.  The panel is fixed before looking at imaging.

The decisive control is **size-matched random gene panels**: a small panel reduced to the
same working dimension can reach the same ceiling for purely dimensional reasons, so the
panel is only informative if it beats random panels of identical size.

The a-priori ccRCC panel reaches the same ceiling as the full 2000-gene set --- but so do
random gene panels of identical size.  Restricting to kidney-cancer biology therefore
does **not** concentrate the signal; the shared axis is not ccRCC-specific.  Read the
other way, the "the panel retains the signal, so the rest of the transcriptome is
irrelevant" reading is unavailable: a size-matched random panel retains it just as well,
which is the signature of a global covariate rather than tumor genotype.

## 6. Is it genomic at all?

Tumor expression covaries strongly with age and sex, and CT encodes both.  If the
ceiling is a demographic proxy it should collapse once the demographic subspace is
projected out of **both** modalities.  Two checks:

1. Demographics are in fact legible in these CT features (sex from a linear decoder,
   age from ridge regression, both cross-validated).
2. The ceiling recomputed on demographic-residualized features, and again after also
   removing scanner manufacturer.

## 7. Total recoverable share and the recoverability spectrum

Two quantities carry the argument.  The **total share** is the mean out-of-sample R^2 of
predicting each of the 2000 genes from CT, which equals
`tr(Sg - S_{G|X}) / tr(Sg)` on standardized genes --- the fraction of transcriptome
variance imaging can recover.  Out-of-sample R^2 is negative under the null (38
components fitted to noise), so the bias-corrected share is observed minus the
permutation null.  The **spectrum** is the cross-validated recoverability of each
successive canonical axis, which says whether the signal is one direction or many.
